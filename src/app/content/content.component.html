        to MetaDetective, the premier online
        tool for fetching and analyzing meta tags from any website URL. Whether you are a web developer, SEO specialist,

    <p class="text-danger fw-semibold">
        What Are Meta Tags and Why Are They Important?
    </p>

    <p class="lh-base">
        Meta tags are snippets of text that describe a webpage's content; they don’t appear on the page itself but only
        in the page's source code. They are small content descriptors that help tell search engines what a web page is
        about. Meta tags are essential for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and social media sharing because they help
        search engines and social platforms understand the content and purpose of a page.
    </p>


    <p class="text-danger fw-semibold">
        Key Types of Meta Tags
    </p>

    <ol class="list-group list-group-numbered">
        <li class="list-group-item">
            <span class="text-danger fw-semibold">Title Tag</span> : This is arguably the most important meta tag. It
            appears at the
            top of a browser's window and as the
            headline in search engine results. A well-crafted title tag can significantly impact your page's ranking.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            <span class="text-danger fw-semibold">Meta Description</span> : This tag provides a brief summary of the
            page content.
            Search engines often display the meta
            description in search results, so a compelling description can improve click-through rates.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            <span class="text-danger fw-semibold">Meta Keywords</span> : While not as important as they once were due to
            changes in search engine algorithms, meta keywords
            can still play a role in some SEO strategies.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            <span class="text-danger fw-semibold">Open Graph Tags</span> : These tags are used by social media platforms
            like Facebook to display shared content
            attractively. They include properties like `og:title`, `og:description`, and `og:image`
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            <span class="text-danger fw-semibold">Twitter Card Tags</span> : Similar to Open Graph tags, Twitter Card
            tags enhance the appearance of shared content on
            Twitter.
        </li>
    </ol>
